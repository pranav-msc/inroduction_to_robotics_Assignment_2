## Problem Statement:

The problem statement is that you are given an initaial frame A,then that frame goes around rotation by an angle theta around some axis.
then after this once the final frame is obtained,say(B),then the coordinates in B frame are given,and we have to determine what where the iniail coordinates.
output will be coordinates in frame A;
You can add as much location as you can.
